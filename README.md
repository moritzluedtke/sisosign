# SISOSIGN

Developed by Moritz LÃ¼dtke

SISOSIGN is a work time calculator on the web. It is intentionally designed for the german market.

## Local Development
- `npm run serve` or `ng serve` runs it locally

## Trivia

1. If you want to know what SISOSIGN stands for you have to take a look at the source code, look carefully through the ui or ask a die hard fan ;)
2. SISOSIGN probably has more users than the developer assumes.
